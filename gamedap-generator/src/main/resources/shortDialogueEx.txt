Pit (excited): “I can’t believe I’m actually flying!”
Palutena (confident): “The power of flight is my gift to you.”
Palutena (neutral): “I’ll control your route so you can focus on battle.”
Palutena (neutral): “But I can only maintain this power for five minutes at a time.”
Palutena (concerned): “After that, your wings will burn up, and you’ll fall.”
Pit (upset): “You have no idea how embarrassing it is to be an angel who can’t fly on his own.”
Pit (serious): “So thanks for your help. Without you, I’d be finished!”
